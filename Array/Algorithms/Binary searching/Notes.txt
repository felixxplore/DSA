Binary searching in array : time complexity : log(n)

tip : when you learn any concept which ask your self :

- when you want to find answer of searching of any element  and traverse each iteration for finding, so you time complexity is O(n)
- here i find element in entire search space :
- binary searching is only applicable only on sorted array

binary searching approach :
- first declare start and end :
- go in loop until start<=end
- find mid using start and end in inner loop
- if (my element == [mid]) return mid;
- if (my element < [mid]) return end=mid-1;
- if (my element > [mid]) return start=mid+1;


apply binary searching using recursive method :
- select paramter : arr, start, end, element
- before find mid apply condition is ready for mid : 
- if start>end : return -1;
- then find mid:
- now if [mid]==element return mid;
- if element > [mid] here call recursive : arr,mid+1,end, element :
- if element < [mid] here call recursive : arr, start, mid-1, element :

- when i solving it needed to return value : 
    - when i solving binary question last me return karna jaruri hain : to we can add else condition default return last call : recursive call :

- what is time complexity of binary in using recursive :
